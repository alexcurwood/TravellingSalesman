# TravellingSalesman

## The Travelling Salesman Problem

Given a list of cities and the distances between them, what is the shortest path to visiting each and returning to the origin city?

## Objective

This project aims to develop 2 basic and 2 enhanced Python algorithms to solve the Travelling Salesman Problem. The algorithms chosen were Basic Greedy Search and Greedy Best First Search.

## Contents

The repository contains 8 city files, detailing the distances between each city, varying in length from 12 to 535 cities. Alongside this are the 4 algorithms (2 basic and 2 enhanced), and the best tour found using Basic Greedy Search and Greedy Best First search for each city file respectively. A proforma detailing the enhancements made to each algorithm is also provided.
